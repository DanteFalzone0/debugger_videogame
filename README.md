# debugger_videogame
Code and associated files for the videogame DEBUGGER, written by Dante Falzone.

To play, put all the files in the same folder and run the program `useof.py`.

This game has the dependency of the Pygame module. If you're running Linux, then
the program `debuginstall.cpp` should install it for you. If not, you'll have to
manually install it. Also, the font `hackerman.ttf` doesn't seem to play nice with
everyone's computer, so the fonts might look wrong if you can't install it.
